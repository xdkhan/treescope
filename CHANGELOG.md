# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-29

First release. An open alternative to Lookin, with first-class SwiftUI inspection.

- **Browser-based view inspector.** The inspected app serves a zero-install web viewer over
  loopback HTTP + WebSocket (`GET /` viewer, `GET /snapshot/{id}` PNG, `GET /ws` JSON protocol).
  The embedded HTTP/1.1 + WebSocket server is built only on `Network.framework` + `CryptoKit` — no
  third-party dependencies enter your app, and it is intended to be Debug-only.
- **Unified hierarchy** of UIKit/AppKit views, SwiftUI nodes, and CALayers in one tree, colour-coded
  by framework, with search/filter, hide-system-views, and full keyboard navigation.
- **Open SwiftUI inspection** via `Mirror` on the opened `any View`: unwraps combinators, descends
  custom `body`, extracts Text/Image/Color, modifiers, and `@State` — using only public reflection.
  Reference-typed observable state is surfaced live.
- **Interactive canvas.** Wireframe + rendered snapshots and an exploded 3D layer view (on by
  default) with drag-to-orbit and angle/depth controls. Figma-style navigation: two-finger swipe /
  scroll to pan in any direction, trackpad pinch or ⌘-scroll to zoom toward the cursor, drag
  anywhere to pan, tap to select. Floating zoom / angle / reset controls.
- **Property inspector** with typed sections, live editing of common view and layer properties,
  on-device highlight, and hover sync with the tree.
- **Default port `50067`** (scans forward on conflict; override via `Treescope.start(preferredPort:)`).
- **Examples.** Package-adopting iOS Simulator and macOS apps under `Examples/`, each with a
  `./run.sh` and a headless WebSocket verifier.
- **One-click release** via `deploy.sh`, and a GitHub Pages site at
  https://everettjf.github.io/treescope/.
